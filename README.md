# PAM-Clustering-
A general approach to PAM Clustering using R. Studio
# In this repository we"ll be using The ciggaret dataset from R.studio 
# After general analysis this dataset seems suitable as it consists of mostly numeric values which is ideal for clustering 
# Using a simple cluster algorithn and focusing on euclidean condition we can sucessfully determine number of clusters and cluster the data accordingly.
